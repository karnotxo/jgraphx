JGraphX is a Java Swing diagramming (graph visualisation) library licensed under the BSD license (see https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx)

Unfortunately JGraphX is [not available at Maven Central](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx/issues/28),
and this project solves that.

Value added by `jgraph-publish`:
* jar, javadoc, and sources are published to Maven Central 
* Gradle build (the code imports in IDEA automatically)
* OSGI manifest entries
* Automatic-Module-Name
